# Resources
Partial list of all the resources that helped me with this project:

- [PyBoy](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy): Great python example and the report is excellent.
- [gbdev](https://gbdev.io/gb-opcodes/optables/): Full optable for all CPU instructions and link to other great resources.
- [Testing](https://emudev.de/gameboy-emulator/testing-our-cpu/): This helped me for writing e2e tests.
